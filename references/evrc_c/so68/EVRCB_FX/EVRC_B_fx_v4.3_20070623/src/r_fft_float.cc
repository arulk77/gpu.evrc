/*****************************************************************
*
* This is an implementation of decimation-in-time FFT algorithm for
* real sequences.  The techniques used here can be found in several
* books, e.g., i) Proakis and Manolakis, "Digital Signal Processing",
* 2nd Edition, Chapter 9, and ii) W.H. Press et. al., "Numerical
* Recipes in C", 2nd Ediiton, Chapter 12.
*
* Input -  There are two inputs to this function:
*
*	1) A float pointer to the input data array 
*	2) An integer value which should be set as +1 for FFT
*	   and some other value, e.g., -1 for IFFT
*
* Output - There is no return value.
*	The input data are replaced with transformed data.  If the
*	input is a real time domain sequence, it is replaced with
*	the complex FFT for positive frequencies.  The FFT value 
*	for DC and the foldover frequency are combined to form the
*	first complex number in the array.  The remaining complex
*	numbers correspond to increasing frequencies.  If the input
*	is a complex frequency domain sequence arranged	as above,
*	it is replaced with the corresponding time domain sequence. 
*
* Notes:
*
*	1) This function is designed to be a part of a noise supp-
*	   ression algorithm that requires 128-point FFT of real
*	   sequences.  This is achieved here through a 64-point
*	   complex FFT.  Consequently, the FFT size information is
*	   not transmitted explicitly.  However, some flexibility
*	   is provided in the function to change the size of the 
*	   FFT by specifying the size information through "define"
*	   statements.
*
*	2) The values of the complex sinusoids used in the FFT 
*	   algorithm are computed once (i.e., the first time the
*	   r_fft function is called) and stored in a table. To
*	   further speed up the algorithm, these values can be
*	   precomputed and stored in a ROM table in actual DSP
*	   based implementations.
*
*	3) In the c_fft function, the FFT values are divided by
*	   2 after each stage of computation thus dividing the
*	   final FFT values by 64.  No multiplying factor is used
*	   for the IFFT.  This is somewhat different from the usual
*	   definition of FFT where the factor 1/N, i.e., 1/64, is
*	   used for the IFFT and not the FFT.  No factor is used in
*	   the r_fft function.
*
*	4) Much of the code for the FFT and IFFT parts in r_fft
*	   and c_fft functions are similar and can be combined.
*	   They are, however, kept separate here to speed up the
*	   execution.
